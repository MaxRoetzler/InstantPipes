# Pipe Tool

A procedural pipe generator with pathfinding

## TODO

### Bugs

- [ ] Height should also take points
- [ ] Sometimes goes through visited!
- [ ] Big grid size: ignores collisions completely

### Pathfinding

- [ ] Handle edge cases, so there's always some path to be found.
- [ ] Grid doesn't work perfectly. Radius or grid for pathfinding?

### Other

- [ ] Refactor everything
- [ ] Multiple pipes at once
- [ ] Selecting an area and filling it with pipes
- [ ] Grid size less then radius

### Readme

- [ ] Overall usage
- [ ] Multiple submeshes, so can assign materials
- [ ] Beware of max vertex count, but just CTRL+Z in case
